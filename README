 Outlines usage and implementation of gitc perl script
------------------------------------------------------------
-------
OVERALL
-------
the gitc script runs an interactive mode and several different reports for
contribution to a git repository. Several flags are also accepted to provide
additional functionality. Functionality follows the format quoted from the
usage message:

The Interactive commands:
  mailmap    Build a mailmap file (see man git-shortlog [MAPPING AUTHORS])
Non-interactive commands:
  help       Display this help
  numstat    Extract contributions using 'git log --numstat'
  blame      Extract contributions using 'git blame'
Options:
  -o f       Output to the file named 'f'
  -m f       Use the file named 'f' as mailmap
  -v         Display verbose output to standard error

-------
MAILMAP
-------
The mailmap command brings up an interactive GUI and allows the user to
input a cononical name and select various authors to link to that name.
It allows the user to combine the stats of various authors combined
under a single name.

To use the mailmap merge button, highlight the names which you wish to
have represented by a different canonical name. Then enter the canonical
name and canonical email into the corresponding text entry boxes at the
bottom. Upon hitting merge, the selected names will be removed and the
canonical name will appear if it was not present previously. This can be
repeated as many times as wanted.

Upon finishing, hit the "Done" button or close the window and the new
mailmap file will be created.

In order for the mailmap GUI to do anything the user must select a name
to merge and provide both a cononical name and a cononical email. If this 
is not done then an error message will be printed to the terminal and the
GUI will hold onto previously entered data until another action is made.

----
HELP
----
Runs the usage message for the file to help the user determine how to
use the script

-------
NUMSTAT
-------
Run through each commit in the git repository and print out a line for
a CSV file for each commit timestamp. The line equals the total amount
the lines added and subtracted from all of the files combined, at a
given time.

-----
BLAME
-----
Run through each file in the git repository and create a line of the
CSV file for each commit timestamp. The line equals the total amount of
lines owned by each individual at the time of the commit, accross all
files.

-----
FLAGS
-----
-v = enables verbose output to give a textual indication of the progress
     of the script as it is executing its task

-m f = enables the input of a mailmap file with the name f to combine
       authors into a single column

-o f = enables the output to a specified file with the name f to hold the
       output CSV or mailmap file
